java have simple syntax java is object oriented language
java has removed explicit pointers ,operator overloading
java is  both compiled as well as interpreted language


2..... SIMPLE
No explicit pointer
Java Programs run inside a virtual machine
Classloader: Classloader in Java is a part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which is used to load Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine dynamically.
Bytecode Verifier: It checks the code fragments for illegal code that can violate access rights to objects.


3......PORTABLE
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It doesn't require any implementation.


4.....ROBUST
It uses strong memory management.
There is a lack of pointers that avoids security problems.

5.....Architecture-neutral
Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features, for example, the size of primitive types is fixed.

6......High-performance
Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code.
But it is still slower than C++ b/c it is a interpeted language


7....Distributed
Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications.


8.....Dynamic
Java is a dynamic language. Java supports the dynamic loading of classes
